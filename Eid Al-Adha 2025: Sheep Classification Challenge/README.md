# 🐑 Eid Al-Adha 2025: Sheep Classification Challenge

Participation in the **Eid Al-Adha 2025: Sheep Classification Challenge** on **Kaggle**, organized by **Dal | دال**.  
The competition aimed to develop a model capable of accurately classifying different breeds of **Arabian sheep** — such as **Naeimi**, **Najdi**, and **Harri** — from real-world images, contributing to the advancement of computer vision in culturally significant contexts.

---

## 🎯 Objective
Develop an image classification model that can identify and distinguish between multiple Arabian sheep breeds using deep learning techniques.

---

## 🚀 Approach
### 🔹 Model Architecture
- Implemented **InceptionV3** as the base convolutional neural network for image classification.

### 🔹 Data Preparation
- Performed **data augmentation** to expand the training dataset and improve model generalization.
- Split data into **training** and **validation** sets, applying augmentation only to the training set.

### 🔹 Training & Evaluation
- Used **TensorFlow/Keras** for model training and fine-tuning.
- Evaluated the model using:
  - **Classification Report**
  - **Confusion Matrix**
- Focused on optimizing the **F1 Score**, which was the official competition metric.

---

## 🧠 Key Insights
- **Transfer learning** with pretrained architectures significantly accelerates model convergence.  
- **Augmentation** helps reduce overfitting and improves performance on unseen data.  
- Monitoring both **precision and recall** ensures balanced model performance.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Google Colab** for model training and experimentation
- **Kaggle API** for dataset access and submission handling

---

## 📈 Results
- Achieved a stable and competitive **F1 Score** across all sheep breed categories.  
- The model successfully distinguished between **Naeimi**, **Najdi**, and **Harri** breeds with good precision and recall.

---

## 🏁 Summary
This project demonstrates the application of **deep learning and computer vision** in agriculture and cultural heritage domains.  
It highlights how AI can support local challenges and innovation within the Saudi AI ecosystem.
