# ü¶¥ Bone Fracture Detection using MobileNet

The **medical field** is one of the most prominent domains that has greatly benefited from **Artificial Intelligence**, especially in **medical image analysis**.  
In this research-based experiment, a **MobileNet** model was applied to detect **bone fractures**, using the **Bone Fracture Multi-Region X-ray** dataset available on **Kaggle**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Experiment Workflow

1. **Data Augmentation**  
   Enhanced the training dataset with augmentation techniques to improve model generalization and robustness.

2. **Pre-trained Model & Fine-Tuning**  
   Utilized **MobileNet** as a pre-trained model and applied **fine-tuning** by modifying the final layers:
   - `GlobalAveragePooling2D`  
   - `Dense layer`  
   - `Dropout(0.5)` to reduce overfitting  
   - Final `Dense` layer for classification  

3. **Regularization & Optimization**  
   Applied:
   - **EarlyStopping** to avoid overtraining when validation accuracy stops improving  
   - **ReduceLROnPlateau** to dynamically adjust the learning rate  

4. **Interactive Interface (Streamlit)**  
   Designed a **Streamlit** web interface allowing users to upload X-ray images and test the model‚Äôs predictions.  
   The app was connected via **pyngrok** for live model testing on real data.
